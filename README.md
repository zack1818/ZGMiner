# ZGMiner
Ravencoin wallet miner (based on GMiner but easier to use for the kawpow algorithim)

# Uses zpool as the default mining pool, after starting the miner, go to https://zpool.ca/wallet/yourwalletaddress and you should be able to see your miner(s)'s stats.

# Note: Your antivirus might detect this software as a malware because it's mining. This is a false positive, just disable your antivirus whenever you want to use it and you're good to go :D
